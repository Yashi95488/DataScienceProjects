# Internship Projects by Yashika Singh

This repository contains the documentation and resources for the projects completed during my internship as a Data Science Intern at **Unified Mentor Pvt. Ltd.** from June 15, 2024, to December 15, 2024.

## Overview
The internship involved independent work on various data analysis, visualization, and machine learning projects, focusing on deriving insights and building tools to solve real-world problems. Below is a brief overview of the projects:

### 1. Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis
- **Objective**: Explore and preprocess a heart disease dataset for further modeling and diagnostic analysis.
- **Tools & Libraries**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- **Key Features**:
  - Data cleaning and transformation.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
  - Insights into risk factors for heart disease.

### 2. Climate Change Modeling
- **Objective**: Perform sentiment analysis on user comments related to climate change.
- **Tools & Libraries**: TextBlob, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud.
- **Key Features**:
  - Sentiment categorization into positive, neutral, and negative.
  - Word cloud visualizations of comment trends.
  - Summary statistics and sentiment distribution.


### 3. Google Play Store Apps Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze app ratings, user reviews, and sentiment to derive insights.
- **Tools & Libraries**: Python (Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn).
- **Key Features**:
  - Sentiment analysis of user reviews.
  - App category performance.
  - Predictive modeling with logistic regression.


### 4. Movie Recommendation System
- **Objective**: Develop a movie recommendation system using collaborative and content-based filtering.
- **Tools & Libraries**: Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy).
- **Key Features**:
  - Collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based).
  - Content-based filtering using movie metadata.
  - Evaluation using RMSE and MAE.

## How to Use
Each project folder contains:
1. Dataset (or links to it).
2. Code files (Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts).
3. Documentation with detailed steps and insights.

## Future Improvements
- Implement advanced machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Develop hybrid recommendation systems for better accuracy.
